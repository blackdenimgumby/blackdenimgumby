### Hi, I'm Antonietta 👋
- 🌱 I’m interested in web development, medical records, and visual art
- ‎‍💻 I work as a medical web application developer
- 🔭 I'm also developing Listymania, a personal site for list lovers using Node, React, and MongoDB, deployed to AWS. I'm creating its graphics in Adobe Illustrator as well. It will be a playground for list-making addicts, dressed in a nostalgic, 90s-inspired design
- 💬 Ask me about Patient Portals 👤 and digital painting 🎨
- ⚡ Challenge me to a pun war!
